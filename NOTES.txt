Executables
-----------

Whilst it would be advantageous to create an executable for each target platform, this is not a necessary
task to get the first release of the utility created.

Researching the options we find:

Launch4J - http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/
JDK based javapackager - http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/deploy/self-contained-packaging.html

# Versions

*0.1*: First working version with enough features to be dangerous

*0.2*: Fix bug where utility would keep processing tasks after one had failed.

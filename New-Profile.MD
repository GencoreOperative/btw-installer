# Creating a 1.5.2 Configuration

If you do not have Minecraft 1.5.2 downloaded, you can create a
new "Configuration" by following these steps:

1) Select the "Launch Options" tab from the Minecraft Launcher.

2) Add a new profile by clicking the "+ Add New" button.

3) Fill in the configuration as follows:

- **Name**: "1.5.2"
- **Version**: "release 1.5.2"
- **Game Directory**: Change this to a location that is not the default.

We have noticed that the Game Directory location must be different from
the default location, otherwise the version will not start.

4) Click "Save" to create the configuration.

5) Run the new configuration from the "News" tab selector. This will
download the 1.5.2 jar file needed for the patching utility to work.

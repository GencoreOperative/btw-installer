TODO: JitWatch - Stream Copy is called many times.
TODO: Release to general public

TODO: Feedback - the patcher does not explain what it will do, or what it has done
TODO: It just does a thing.

Chris fell foul of a few things:
- Setup the 1.5.2 release and run it to download the 1.5.2.jar.
- Requirement that the 1.5.2 release must be a separate configuration folder to later versions
Once both of these were sorted out, we were set.

Again: the UI does not explain what has happened or what is going to happen.
What would a UI look like that explains that to the user?

Introduce a Patching Service class which provides the highest level of
function below the user interface. This can be used to automated patch
testing which can be performed per release.

Automated Patch Testing
Each patch in the /static folder should be tested automatically with
the installer on each platform to simplify the process of testing and
verifying behaviour.
Robot tests?
What are we trying to test? Patching behaviour is critical and should
be tested on each build. User Interface behaviour is harder to test.

Server Mode
Update the patcher to support Server Mode, as well as Client Mode.
Question is answer is - how can the user easily select which mode?
Preferred Option is to create a separate installer which the user can opt to download.

Drop Target
Update the Patch chooser to support Drag and Drop for File targets

Update Documentation
- Include remove instructions on separate page

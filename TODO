Server Mode
Update the patcher to support Server Mode, as well as Client Mode.
Question is answer is - how can the user easily select which mode?
Preferred Option is to create a separate installer which the user can opt to download.

Application Icon
Create a custom icon for the application which appears on the JDialog.

Localization
Windows - no task bar icon - Likely because we are using JDialog rather than a JFrame.
Linux - Task bar entry for Ubuntu

Errors
If an error occurs during ProgressWorker, it is currently not shown with
a dialog.

JitWatch - Stream Copy is called many times.
Can we optimise this slightly?

Tool Tips
Update the UI to provide tool tips on mouse over

Drop Target
Update the Patch chooser to support Drag and Drop for File targets

Removal Instructions
Separate documentation page for removing the patch.
